        <p>This about page is an idea from <a href="https://nownownow.com/about">Derek Sivers</a>, it tells you what I am working on right now:</p>
<h2 id="enjoying-and-working-on-my-new-old-house">Enjoying and working on my new old house<a href="#enjoying-and-working-on-my-new-old-house" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>Last spring we moved to a cozy little house far outside of the city. As the weather cools I am working on more and more inside the house. The small neighborhood vibe and Christmas lights, my first fireplace all make the winter more pleasant.</p>
<h2 id="celebrating-the-holidays-with-friends-and-family">Celebrating the holidays with friends and family<a href="#celebrating-the-holidays-with-friends-and-family" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>After last years pause on parties, I was grateful to be able to see my family for the holidays again this year. I recently went to the Art Institute with friends I haven&rsquo;t seen for a while. This was probably the longest stretch of not visiting the Art Institute as well.</p>
<h2 id="reflecting-on-the-year-and-planning-next">Reflecting on the year and planning next<a href="#reflecting-on-the-year-and-planning-next" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>This is the time of year, I start to review what I have done this year and what I had hoped to have done. This year already looks like a win in many catagories.</p>
<h2 id="writing">Writing<a href="#writing" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>Setting up this new site on <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>. I chose Hugo for it&rsquo;s speed and the fact that it&rsquo;s open source. After a break, I am back to writing about things that interest me and take me down rabit holes. This is where I will post them.</p>
<h2 id="planning-garden-for-next-spring">Planning garden for next spring<a href="#planning-garden-for-next-spring" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>There is a lot of work to be done before anything can be planted. The goal is to balance productive fertility and an aesthetically pleasing retreat.</p>
<h2 id="rehabbing-knee-pain-from-running">Rehabbing knee pain from running<a href="#rehabbing-knee-pain-from-running" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>I started running a couple years ago and finally got the hang of it this summer. Then I went to far and got an overuse injury. Trying to rehab it myself with information from others, books and youtube.</p>
